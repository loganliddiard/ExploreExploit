## Part 1

The epsilong value that produces the highest reward ratio on average is the epsiolon of .01

We believe this is because once it has found when it beleives is a better reward system, it is much less likely to change and go somewhere else.
On the flip side of this coin, the value that seems to perfom the worst is an epsiolon value of .4. This is simply because it is much more likley to explore even after it is found what it beleives is the best reward.

Here is the output of one of our tests to prove this:
